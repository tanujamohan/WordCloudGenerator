	<h1> Song Title by Artist </h1>
	<p class="lyrics" id="song"> Oh whoa [x3]<br>
            You know you love me, I know you care <br>
            Just shout whenever, and I'll be there<br>
            You are my love, you are my heart<br>
            And we would never ever ever be apart<br>
            <br>
            Are we an item? Girl, quit playing<br>
            We're just friends, what are you saying?<br>
            Say there's another and look right in my eyes<br>
            My first love broke my heart for the first time<br>
            And I was like...<br>
			<br>
            Baby, baby, baby oooh<br>
            Like baby, baby, baby nooo<br>
            Like baby, baby, baby oooh<br>
            I thought you'd always be mine (mine)<br>
            <br>
            Baby, baby, baby oooh<br>
            Like baby, baby, baby nooo<br>
            Like baby, baby, baby oooh<br>
            I thought you'd always be mine (mine)<br>
            <br>
            Oh, for you I would have done whatever<br>
            And I just can't believe we ain't together<br>
            And I wanna play it cool, but I'm losin' you<br>
            I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring<br>
            And I'm in pieces, baby fix me<br>
            And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream<br>
            I'm going down, down, down, down<br>
            And I just can't believe my first love won't be around<br>
            <br>
            And I'm like<br>
            Baby, baby, baby oooh<br>
            Like baby, baby, baby nooo<br>
            Like baby, baby, baby oooh<br>
            I thought you'd always be mine (mine)<br>
            <br>
            Baby, baby, baby oooh<br>
            Like baby, baby, baby nooo<br>
            Like baby, baby, baby oooh<br>

            [Ludacris:]<br>
            Luda! When I was 13, I had my first love,<br>
            There was nobody that compared to my baby<br>
            And nobody came between us or could ever come above<br>
            She had me going crazy, oh, I was star-struck,<br>
            She woke me up daily, don't need no Starbucks.<br>
            She made my heart pound, it skipped a beat when I see her in the street and<br>
            At school on the playground but I really wanna see her on the weekend.<br>
            She knows she got me dazing cause she was so amazing<br>
            And now my heart is breaking but I just keep on saying...<br>
            <br>
            Baby, baby, baby oooh<br>
            Like baby, baby, baby nooo<br>
            Like baby, baby, baby oooh<br>
            I thought you'd always be mine (mine)<br>
            <br>
            Baby, baby, baby oooh<br>
            Like baby, baby, baby nooo<br>
            Like baby, baby, baby oooh<br>
            I thought you'd always be mine (mine)<br>
            <br>
            I'm gone (Yeah Yeah Yeah, Yeah Yeah Yeah)<br>
            Now I'm all gone (Yeah Yeah Yeah, Yeah Yeah Yeah)<br>
            Now I'm all gone (Yeah Yeah Yeah, Yeah Yeah Yeah)<br>
            Now I'm all gone (gone, gone, gone...)<br>
            I'm gone<br><br>
